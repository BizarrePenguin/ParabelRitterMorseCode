# ParabelRitterMorseCode
This is a fun side project to detect and translate the morsecode found in this youtube video https://youtu.be/R3K5_4TT5kA?t=1780 that appears in the lower left corner as a blinking blue square approx. between 29:40 and 33:00.

The code was generated with the help of ChatGPT, although I needed to do a lot of corrections and give ideas because ChatGPT was not good enough in understanding the goal and being consistent with package use and variable names.

Feel free to clone this to play around with it yourself or use this as a start for similar projects.

Note, that if you want to execute the code yourself you first need to download the youtube video with any external tool and save it under the file name "parabelRitter.mp4" in the folder of the code. You would also need to have the python packages installed that are used in this Jupyter Notebook and have a way of running Jupyter Notebooks.
